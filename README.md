The blog site contains my notes, articles, and links that I found useful in the topics of my interests.
AI, NLP, and coding are what I am mainly interested in right now and I use writings as a way of enhancing 
my learning and sharing it with others. It was said that sharing is caring, but I want to add that sharing
means self-growth and empowerment for other people. I hope you find them useful.
