#### Dietrich Bonhoeffer
Dietrich Bonhoeffer, the great German pastor, theologian, martyr, spy was asked in 1943 how it was possible
 for the Church to sit back and let Hitler seize absolute power.
 His firm answer: "It was the teaching of cheap grace."
```markdown
Cheap grace is the preaching of forgiveness without requiring repentance,
 baptism without church discipline, communion without confession,
 absolution without personal confession.
Cheap grace is grace without discipleship,
 grace without the cross, grace without Jesus Christ."
 - Dietrich Bonhoeffer
```
We live in a time and culture that not only teaches cheap grace but praises it.

#### Theodor Roosvelt
```markdown
It is not the critic who counts; not the man who points out how the strong man stumbles, 
or where the doer of deeds could have done them better. 
The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena, 
whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood; who strives valiantly; 
who errs, who comes short again and again, because there is no effort without error 
and shortcoming; but who does actually strive to do the deeds; who knows great enthusiasms, 
the great devotions; who spends himself in a worthy cause; 
who at the best knows in the end the triumph of high achievement, and who at the worst, 
if he fails, at least fails while daring greatly, so that his place shall never be with 
those cold and timid souls who neither know victory nor defeat.
  -- Theodor Roosvelt

Instead, teach them to yearn for the vast and endless sea.
