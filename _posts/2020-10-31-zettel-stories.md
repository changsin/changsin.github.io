```markdown
A jackal comes up to a lion and said, "Fight with me."
The lion does not even look at him.
The jackal challenges him, "If you don't fight with me,
I am going to tell everyone that you are afraid of me."
The lion slowly turned to him and wincing,
"It is better to be blamed for cowardice than to fight with a jackal."
```
