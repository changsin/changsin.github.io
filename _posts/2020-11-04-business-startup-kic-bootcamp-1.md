### Venture Ready Scores
1. Team: Why you, balanced team (talents, diversity), domain experts,
serially successful founders, great company experience
2. Idea: Are you solving a problem? New or existing problem, big category
(vs tool), early/late continuum, technically achievable, pain pill or vitamin
3. Product: Do you have a product, how mature, customer first, solid design,
clear road map to scale
4. Market/Customer: big market (TAM/SOM), cash available, new or nascent market?
5. Competition: How many incumbents, funding status, are you incrementally
better or 10x better?
6. Traction: Customer validation, revenue, improving unit economics?
7. Timing: Why now? Are you late, early, too early?
8. Revenue Model/Finance: How will you monetize your idea? Do you have
a basic budget on spending, big or small economics?
9. IP/Moat: Is your idea defensible? Can you build a moat over time?
10. Clear Ask: What do you need help with? Advice, funding, introduction,
help finding staff?
