### Venture Ready Scores
1. Team: Why you, balanced team (talents, diversity), domain experts,
serially successful founders, great company experience
2. Idea: Are you solving a problem? New or existing problem, big category
(vs tool), early/late continuum, technically achievable, pain pill or vitamin
3. Product: Do you have a product, how mature, customer first, solid design,
clear road map to scale
4. Market/Customer: big market (TAM/SOM), cash available, new or nascent market?
5. Competition: How many incumbents, funding status, are you incrementally
better or 10x better?
6. Traction: Customer validation, revenue, improving unit economics?
7. Timing: Why now? Are you late, early, too early?
8. Revenue Model/Finance: How will you monetize your idea? Do you have
a basic budget on spending, big or small economics?
9. IP/Moat: Is your idea defensible? Can you build a moat over time?
10. Clear Ask: What do you need help with? Advice, funding, introduction,
help finding staff?

## Research & Competitive Analysis

## Markets
What is the market and who is the customer?

#### TAM (Total Addressable Market)

### SAM (Service Addressable Market)
* Or Serviceable Available Market
* The part of the market that can actually be reached
  * sales and marketing driven
  * with the feature you have now
  * with the product roadmap you have
  * competition
* Not everyone that might use it, if they found it, if it was in their language and currency

#### SOM (Service Obtainable Market)
* The subset of the market you can capture
* A proxy for short term upside
* Not aspirational

#### LAM (Launch Addressable Market)
What can buy your product at MVP?
* Given your TAM, SAM, and SOM - WHO is the customer?
* With Limited Features?
* Who can you sell today?
  * B2B
  * B2C
  * Buyer profile
 *What features will you need to launch to expand your market and price?

### GTM (Go-To-Market)
* Have a plan for how you get your first customers?
* Your LAM maps to your Go-To-Market
  * customer
  * value prop
  * pricing
  * marketing spend and sales effort

### Market Conditions
* Nascent/New market: Uber, AirBnB
* Large markets: >$100M or $1B
  * Large market provides "at bat" opportunities
  * small markets suck
* Headwinds or tailwinds?
  * Covid

### Who is your customer?
* Product vs. Services
  * Product is something you can deliver or ship - can you make $$ while you sleep
  * Services require people to deliver on the value and promise - consulting or a restaurant
* Who pays the bill?
  * A business
  * The consumer
* The product user and who pays can be different as in Facebook or Google
that make money on advertising

### Why/How do they buy?
* Make money vs. save money?
* Searching for product?
* Needs to be sold

## Value Propositions
### Positioning
* Positioning is holding a place in your customers' mind - not as everything.
What's memorable?
* Who is the initial customer?
* Think about limiting service and customer first - before you expand
  * You are not precluded from selling other services or products
* What claim or promise will you make?
* Don't buy the lead
  * Think of this like journalism
  * What's the headline?
  * What's the lead?
  * What's the story?
### Testing
* Each pitch is a rapid A/B testing
* Look for 1:Many opportunities to test your value proposition
  * Trade shows
  * peers
* Test tag lines
### Taglines
* The one sentence summary
* Pull from the madlibs pitch
* Benefits to customer - not features
* Simple
* Evolve with the company

### Branding
* You don't have a big budget - so you can't afford brand advertising
* Start with brand neutral and build
* Memorable
* Phonetically easy to spell
* Avoid double letters, etc.

## Customer Development Data
* Parallel process with Product Development
* "Get out of the building"
* Develop for a few, not many
* Prioritize features based on needs, not wants
* Validate with revenue/commitment

## What is customer development?
* Four steps of an epiphany -- Steve Blank

### A. Iteration
1. Customer Discovery: Turn hypothesis into facts
2. Customer Validation: Identify scalable and repeatable sales model

### B. Execution
3. Customer Creation
4. Company Building

### Customer Development Goals
* Acute focus on problem - not product
* Find out if customers care?
* What do they want?
* Determines the difference your product at launch and at scale
* Feature priorities & Product roadmap

### Customer Dev Mechanics
* Google forms
* structured questions
  * Progression
  * What do you really want to know?
  * Will they pay for it? How much?
  * Why will it fail?
* Neutral, not guided questions

* Build a list of interested parties
  * mail chimp list setup
  * ask for permission to email
  * monthly updates: format - "what we did, what we are going to do
  and where we can use your help"
* Regular frequency: be predictable

### What not to do
* You are not the customer
* Don't tolerate a small sample set - this could delay your success by years
* Avoid "selection bias": "isn't our product amazing"
* No rhetorical questions
* No blind surveys
* Can't outsource

## Awkward Co-Founder Discussions
* Setup a process to get the expectations out in the open
* Pre-incorporation
  * Meeting 1 of 2
    * Why do you want to do this
    * Capital in vs. out
    * Timing of life
    * Passion
  * Go to Startup Equity Calculator
  * Meeting 2 of 2
    * Print out a copy - bring it to the meeting
    * How far off are you? What responsibilities?
  * At incorporation
    * Reverse vesting schedule
    * What happens when someone leaves?
  * Option pool 20%
  * Why 50/50 is the only wrong decision
* Post Incorporation
* Milestones/Deliverables
* Slicing Pie
  * Market rates: Don't over inflate
  * Track time and contribution
  * Regular meeting: weekly standups
 * Make HR changes fast - they won't  get easier
