### 1. Idea
* Spend some time to think through ideas, the long term effect.
* The idea comes first; the startup comes second.
* Best companies are mission-oriented.
  * The company should feel like an important mission.
  * Good startups take ten years.
  * Derivative ideas do not excite people.
* Best ideas seem terrible at the beginning.
  * Need conviction in your own ideas.
  * Don't need to worry about sharing your ideas.
  * Unpopular but right ideas.
* The growth of the market is more important than the growth of the company.
  * Can't create a market
* Why now? -- Sequoia
  * Build something you need
* If it takes more than a sentence to explain, it's not a good idea.
* Think about the market first.

### 2. Product
* Build something users love.
* Talk to users.
* Better to build something small users love than something a lot of people like.
  * The amount of love is the same. It's just about how it is distributed.
* Don't worry about competitors.
* It takes some fanatics to build a great product.
* Pick a small number of users by hand.

### 3. Team

### 4. Execution
