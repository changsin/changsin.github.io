### 1. Idea
* Spend some time to think through ideas, the long term effect.
* The idea comes first; the startup comes second.
* Best companies are mission-oriented.
  * The company should feel like an important mission.
  * Good startups take ten years.
  * Derivative ideas do not excite people.
* Best ideas seem terrible at the beginning.
  * Need conviction in your own ideas.
  * Don't need to worry about sharing your ideas.
  * Unpopular but right ideas.
* The growth of the market is more important than the growth of the company.
  * Can't create a market
* Why now? -- Sequoia
  * Build something you need
* If it takes more than a sentence to explain, it's not a good idea.
* Think about the market first.

### 2. Product
* Build something users love.
* Talk to users.
* Better to build something small users love than something a lot of people like.
  * The amount of love is the same. It's just about how it is distributed.
* Don't worry about competitors.
* It takes some fanatics to build a great product.
* Pick a small number of users by hand.


## Lecture 2 - Team and Execution (Sam Altman)

### 3. Team
A. Cofounders: relentlessly resourceful. "James Bond"
  * Know your cofounders - tough & calm

B. Try not to hire: have a high bar. Get a small number of dedicated people.

C: Get the best people: 0 - 25% of your time.

* Mediocre engineers do not build great companies.
* Hire from people you already know (referrals).
* Go for the aptitude, not experience in early days.
  * Are they smart?
  * Do they get things done?
  * Do I want to spend a lot of time around?

  * Good communication skills
  * Manically determined
  * Pass the animal test (Paul Graham): be able to describe as an animal
  * Would feel comfortable reporting to them.
   Enjoy working with them. Or at least respect them.
   
* Equity: be ready to give up to 10% to employees

D. You've hired the best - now keep them around.
* What motivates people: autonomy & mastery

E. Fire fast
* persistently negative

### 4. Execution
* CEO jobs
  * Set the vision
  * Raise money
  * Evangelize
  * Hire and manage
  * Make sure the entire company executes

* Can you get it done?
  * Focus:
    * What are you spending time and money on?
    * What are the two and three most important things?
    * Say no. A lot.
    * Set overarching goals. Repeat them.
    * Communicate.
  * Intensity:
    * Relentless operating rhythm
    * Obsession with Execution Quality
    * Bias towards action - Indecisiveness is a startup killer.
      * Every time you talk to them, they've gotten new things done.
      * Do it incrementally
      * Quick
      * Do whatever it takes
      * Show up
      * Don't give up

* Always keep momentum: keep growing
  * Save vision speeches for when you are winning.
    When you are losing, you just have to have some small wins.
    Sales fix everything.
  * Shipping product
  * Launching new features
  * Reviewing/reporting metrics regularly

 The competitor to be feared is one who never bothers about you at all,
  but goes on making his own business better all the time.
