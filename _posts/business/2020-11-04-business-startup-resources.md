People have this vision of being the CEO of a company they started and being on top of the pyramid...
What it's really like: everyone else is your boss -- all of your employees, customers, partners, users, media are you boss.

## Presentations

### [The single biggest reason why start-ups succeed | Bill Gross](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNpx7gpSqbY):
* Founder of IdeaLab
  * Idea: ideas are not everything
  * Team: execution - adaptability - the customer is the true reality
  * Business model
  * Funding
  * Timing
* Top 5 factors in success
1. Timing (42%): AirBnB and Uber came right after the great recession when people needed extra money
to overcome their initial rejection of the ideas. CitySearch belongs to the same category when
people were looking for cost-effective ways to build web sites. On the other hand, Z.com was
an online entertainment company and we had high hopes. But broadband penetration was too low
in 1990-2000. A couple of years later when broadband was available, youtube came out perfectly timed and
had a great success.
2. Team/Execution (32%)
3. Idea "Truth" Outlier (28%)
4. Business Model (24%)
5. Funding (14%)
