#### Lecture Plan
Lecture 1: Introduction and Word Vectors
1. The course (10 mins)
2. Human language and word meaning (15 mins)
3. Word2vec introduction (15 mins)
4. Word2vec objective function gradients (25 mins)
5. Optimization basics (5 mins)
6. Looking at word vectors (10 mins or less)

### How do we represent the meaning of a word?
#### 1. As discrete symbols

* "denotational semantics": commonest linguistic way of thinking of meaning

```markdown
  signifier (symbol) ‚ü∫ signified (idea or thing)
```
 aka. representational theory of meaning

* How do we have usable meaning in a computer?
Common solution: WordNet, a thesaurus containing Lists of synonym lists and hypernyms ("is a" relationships)
  * Problems
      * Great as a resource but missing nuance
      * Missing new meanings of words
      * subjective
      * Requires human labor to create and adapt
      * Can't compute accurate word similarity

#### Representing words as discrete symbols

In traditional NLP, we regard words as discrete symbols: a localist representation:
"hotel", "conference", "motel", etc.

Words can be represented by one-hot vectors


- motel = \[ 0 0 1 0 \]
- hotel = \[ 0 1 0 0 \]


Problems
The two vectors are orthogonal, no natural notion of similarity.

Solution:
* Could try to reply on [WordNet's](https://wordnet.princeton.edu/) list of synonyms to get similarity?
   * But it is well-known to fail badly: incompleteness, etc.
* Instead: learn to encode similarity in the vectors themselves

#### Representing words by their context
** Distributional semantics***: A word's meaning is given by the words that
frequently appear close-by

   * One of the most successful ideas of modern statistical NLP!

### Word vectors
* Build a dense vector for each word, chosen so that it is similar to
vectors of words that appear in similar context.
* word vectors are sometimes called word embeddings or word representations.
They are distributed representations.

* Word2vec ([Mikolov et al. 2013](https://papers.nips.cc/paper/2013/file/9aa42b31882ec039965f3c4923ce901b-Paper.pdf))
 is a framework for learning word vectors
* Idea
  * We have a large corpus of text
  * Every word in a fixed vocabulary is represented by a vector
  * Go through each position t in the text, which has a center word _c_ and context ("outside") words _o_
  * Use the similarity of the word vectors for _c_ and _o_ to calculate the probability of _o_ given _c_ (or vice versa)
  * Keep adjusting the word vectors to maximize this probability.

* Objective function
For each position $$t = 1, ..., T$$, predict context words within a window of fixed size m,
 given a center word $$w_{j}$$

$$
L (\theta) = \prod_{t = 1}^{T} \prod_{ -m \leq j \leq m \hspace{0.8mm} (j \neq 0) }  P(w_{t+j}|w_{t};\theta)
$$
* $$\theta$$ is all variables to be optimized


The objective function $$J(\theta)$$ is the (average) negative log likelihood:

$$
J (\theta) = -\frac{1}{T}logL(\theta) =
    \prod_{t = 1}^{T} \prod_{ -m \leq j \leq m \hspace{0.8mm} (j \neq 0) }  log P(w_{t+j}|w_{t};\theta)
$$

* Question: How to calculate $$ P(w_{t+j}|w_{t};\theta) $$?
  * Answer: We will use two vectors per word w:
    * $$v_{w}$$ when w is a center word
    * $$u_{w}$$ when w is a context word
Then for a center word c and a context word 0:
$$
P(o|c) = \frac{exp(u_{o}^{T}v_{c})}{\sum_{w  \in V}exp(u_{w}^{T}v_{c})}
$$
